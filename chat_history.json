The mining will be time-based, displaying the mined amount on the screen, with a rate of 0.1 Maxcoin per 2 hours.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n*   **Home Screen/Dashboard:** Display the current amount of mined Maxcoin, the mining rate (0.1 MXI / 2 hours), and a visual representation of the mining progress.\n*   **Binance Integration (Conceptual):** Initially, this will be a placeholder. Since direct Binance API integration requires user authentication and secure key management (which is beyond the scope of this initial phase), we'll simulate the connection. A button will indicate \"Connect to Binance\" and, upon pressing, show a mock confirmation.\n*   **Multi-Level Mining:** Implement a basic level system. The initial version can have a single mining level. Future versions can expand on this.\n*   **Withdrawal Feature (Conceptual):** A \"Withdraw\" button will be present. Pressing it will display a modal/form sheet where the user can enter a simulated Binance address to withdraw to. This will not actually perform a transaction.\n*   **Profile Screen:** A screen to display user information (initially, this can be mock data).\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#f0f2f5` (Light gray for a clean look)\n    *   Text: `#2d3436` (Dark gray for readability)\n    *   TextSecondary: `#747d8c` (Medium gray for less important text)\n    *   Primary: `#007bff` (A classic blue for primary actions)\n    *   Secondary: `#6c757d` (A neutral gray for secondary actions)\n    *   Accent: `#ffc107` (A yellow for highlights and points of interest)\n    *   Card: `#ffffff` (White for cards and containers)\n    *   Highlight: `#9bc8ff` (Light blue to highlight interactive elements)\n*   **Typography:** Use a modern, clean font like \"System\" or \"Roboto\" for a professional look.\n\n**Implementation Plan:**\n\n1.  **Modify `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx`:**\n    *   Implement the main dashboard with the mining progress display.\n    *   Add the \"Connect to Binance\" button (placeholder).\n    *   Add the \"Withdraw\" button (placeholder with a modal/form sheet).\n    *   Display the current mined Maxcoin amount.\n2.  **Modify `app/(tabs)/profile.tsx`:**\n    *   Add mock user data to the profile screen.\n3.  **Modify `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx`:**\n    *   Ensure the tab bar includes icons for the Home and Profile screens.\n4.  **Create `app/formsheet.tsx`:**\n    *   Implement the form sheet for the \"Withdraw\" feature (placeholder).\n5.  **Remove `modalDemos` array from `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx`:**\n    *   Remove the `modalDemos` array from the `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` file.\n\nNow, I will instruct the coding agent to implement the plan and modify the app/(tabs) folder to implement the changes and make the changes visible for the user. After that, the coding agent should remove the `modalDemos` array from `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx`.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-11-08T17:26:16.529954"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you create a multi-level cryptocurrency mining app for Maxcoin MXI.
